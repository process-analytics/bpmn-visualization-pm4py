# Integration between `bpmn-visualization` and `pm4py`
This is an example integration between [bpmn-visualization](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/) and [PM4PY](https://github.com/pm4py).

## Architecture
The application consists of two main components: the frontend written in JavaScript and the backend written in Python. 
* The frontend uses **bpmn-visualization** to visualize the BPMN process model and the statistics data over it. 
* The backend is built using **pm4py** which processes data to perform process discovery and conformance checking. The results are then communicated to the frontend through [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

In addition to bpmn-visualization and pm4py, the application also leverages two other libraries, [d3](https://d3js.org/) and [BPMN layout generators](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-layout-generators). 
* **d3** is used to manipulate colors and add a legend to the visualized BPMN diagrams.
* **BPMN layout generators** is used to generate the layout of the discovered BPMN process models produced by pm4py. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that BPMN layout generators is still in an **experimental version** and may not produce optimal or visually appealing layouts.

## Prerequisites

You can skip this part if your system meets all the requirements listed below üëá

* [Backend requirements](./backend/README.md)
* [Frontend requirements](./frontend/README.md)


## Setup
* Clone the project in your preferred IDE (e.g. VScode)
* Prepare the backend environment:
    1. Navigate to the `backend` folder: `cd backend`
    2. Create a virtual environment for dependencies called `venv` using the following command: 
        ```sh 
          python -m venv venv
        ```
    3. Activate the created `venv` by running:
        * **Windows**: 
        ```sh 
          venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
        * **Unix/MacOS**:
        ```sh
          venv/bin/activate
        ```
    4. Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` by running:
        ```sh
          pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
* Prepare the frontend environment:
    1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder: `cd ../frontend` 
    2. Install the required libraries listed in `package.json` by running:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
## Run
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder: `cd backend`
2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend`folder: `cd frontend`
4. Run the development web server: 
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Access the web application on the displayed localhost: http://localhost:5173/
